/**
 * RetryScheduler - Persistent retry queue for failed webhooks
 *
 * When immediate retries (seconds-scale) are exhausted and a webhook still fails,
 * it's added to a persistent JSONL queue file. The scheduler checks the queue
 * every 60 seconds and retries at increasing intervals:
 *   - 1st deferred: 5 minutes
 *   - 2nd deferred: 30 minutes
 *   - 3rd deferred: 1 hour
 *
 * After all deferred attempts fail, the entry is removed and a final history
 * entry is written. Queue entries survive app restarts.
